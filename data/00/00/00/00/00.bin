  |   Shadowgate is one of the most well-known and beloved adventure        |
  |   titles in gaming history. It quickly endeared players with its        |
  |   fantastic atmospheric soundtrack, perilous locations to progress      |
  |   through, countless puzzles to solve, and more ways to gruesomely      |
  |   die than gamers previously thought possible. Thrust into the role     |
  |   of "The Seed of Prophecy", players travel deep into the castle, in    |
  |   hopes of defeating the evil that dwells within - the dreaded          |
  |   Warlock Lord.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   That legendary adventure has been redesigned from the ground up,      |
  |   adding in tons of new mind-bending puzzles, lots of new rooms with    |
  |   stunning hand-painted 2D graphical details, and more objects to       |
  |   interact with.                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This new console version builds upon the massively re-imagined        |
  |   remake of the original Shadowgate and features a refined user         |
  |   interface and intuitive wheel-based icon command system to help       |
  |   players along on their quest.                                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |   For the ultimate challenge, try Ironman mode that disables saves      |
  |   and requires players to finish the game in one try.                   |
  |                                                                         |
